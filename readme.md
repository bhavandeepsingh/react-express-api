# Kinde Starter Kit - React with Express API

The React part of the application lives in the `client` folder and the Express part in the `server` folder.

To get started set up an account on [Kinde](https://app.kinde.com/register).

Install dependencies with `npm i` in both the `client` and `server` directories.

In the `client` folder make a copy of `.env-sample` and name it simply `.env`. Rename the value of `REACT_APP_KINDE_DOMAIN` environment variable to be the subdomain you set up on Kinde.
